            <h3>THE ROOTS</h3>
            <p>
              Our entire life when we shop, we are limited by choices that are there in a store. We are often on the side
              where we buy our favourite coloured shoes made by someone else but what if we designed it? What if we could
              involve in the making of a shoe we want to buy? This little thought sprouted to become what we are today, KICKSUP! :)

            <h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
            <p>
              Understanding the trends in the industry and what the users think when they buy were our top priorities before we
              moved further in the building. After weeks of fruitful research, we stepped into the user’s shoes and looked at
              what we plan to do. It’s a great joy for the users if they are involved in the making. We’re heading into an era
              of technology and people prefer online shopping to shopping in an outlet.

            <h3>CHAPTER II</h3>
            <p>
              Every milestone begins with a single step and before KICKSUP sprouted, the team manufactured in small scale with
              two users a month. This experience was crucial to our brand as this is our first practical experience. Interacting
              with the users was the best thing ever. The positive reviews and support from people motivated us to push our limits further.
